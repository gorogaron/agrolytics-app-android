# agrolytics-app-android
This is an Android application built to measure wood pile volume based on an image. The measurement is done based on the result of image segmentation deep learning models. The segmentation can be done by a cloud-based model which requires internet connection, or by a less accurate offline model in tflite format.

The application used Firebase as a backend, but I am no longer maintaining this project so the whole backend service is shut down.

Some screenshots from the app:
